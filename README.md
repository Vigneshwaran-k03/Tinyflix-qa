# README â€“ TinyFlix QA Analysis

## 1. Setup Instructions

- Clone the TinyFlix repository from GitHub.  
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.  
- Run `npm run dev` to launch the development server and get the testing link.  
- Use Selenium with Python to automate test scenarios.  
- **Technologies used**: Python, Selenium, GitHub, Windsurf.

## 2. Overview of Testing Approach

- Started with manual testing to design a **test plan** and **test cases** covering:
  - Functional Testing  
  - Non-Functional Testing (Accessibility and Performance)  
  - Edge Case and Error Handling  

- After verifying manually, implemented **automated testing** using Selenium (Python).  
- Generated the following reports:
  - Accessibility Report  
  - Bug Report  
  - Performance Analysis  

- Tools used: Selenium, Python, Excel, MS Word, Windsurf.

## 3. Summary of Findings

### Key Issues Found
- Signin and Signup pages are not available.  
- Video playback feature does not work.  
- Duplicate bookmarks can be created.  
- Icons like the mute button do not have accessible labels.

### Positive Observations
- Website loads quickly and is responsive.  
- Search, sort, and filter functions work effectively.  
- Comment functionality is smooth and intuitive.

## 4. Assumptions and Limitations

- The website is still in development and lacks some essential features.  
- Testing was done only in **Microsoft Edge**, so results may differ on other browsers.  
- Accessibility testing did not include screen readers or mobile devices.  
- The video player lacks advanced features such as resolution selection, full screen mode, and offline download.  
- Signin/Signup functionality should be implemented for a complete user flow.
